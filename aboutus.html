            <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
            <h4>
            <p>In today's digital era, social media engagement encompasses over half of the global population. This vast audience presents both opportunities and challenges. Major social media corporations have harnessed artificial intelligence (AI) to curate content for users, often leading them toward unproductive and addictive material. Simultaneously, a concerning issue is the proliferation of hate speech through anonymous accounts. Our inspiration is to tackle these dual challenges simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <h4>
            <p>We envision the creation of a mobile application for phones and a browser extension for PCs, compatible with all social media platforms. The primary objective is to empower users to curate the content they consume while subverting the influence of major social media corporations' algorithms. More like using AI to block another AI. To address the problem of hate speech, our app will utilize a dataset containing patterns of hate speech to promptly identify and remove offending comments upon posting.</p>
