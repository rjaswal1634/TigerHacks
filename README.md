In today's digital era, social media engagement encompasses over half of the global population. This vast audience presents both opportunities and challenges. Major social media corporations have harnessed artificial intelligence (AI) to curate content for users, often leading them toward unproductive and addictive material. Simultaneously, a concerning issue is the proliferation of hate speech through anonymous accounts. Our inspiration is to tackle these dual challenges simultaneously.

We envision the creation of a mobile application for phones and a browser extension for PCs, compatible with all social media platforms. The primary objective is to empower users to curate the content they consume while subverting the influence of major social media corporations' algorithms. More like using AI to block another AI. To address the problem of hate speech, our app will utilize a dataset containing patterns of hate speech to promptly identify and remove offending comments upon posting.

Due to limited experience, we initiated the project by building a prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We established a sample website that displays only the categories selected by the user while concealing the rest. To identify and filter out hate speech in comments, we employed word-matching techniques with a dataset containing offensive terms.

Our constrained knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript presented a substantial challenge. Our original plan involved reading text from files, but difficulties arose in file handling. As a solution, we adapted by creating an array of these terms, bypassing the need for file reading. Filtering out hate comments proved to be our most formidable obstacle.

We take pride in completing this project from the ground up within a mere 36-hour timeframe. The entire project was developed from scratch, and our team gained a substantial amount of knowledge in the process. We enhanced our ability to brainstorm project ideas and translate them into tangible solutions for real-world issues. Additionally, we improved our proficiency in optimizing online resources, thereby enhancing overall project performance.

While this initial project lacked the utilization of APIs and advanced AI, we aspire to continue its development as our skills grow. In a world where people are increasingly consumed by unproductive content on social media, we envision that initiatives like ours can play a vital role in mitigating these issues and fostering a healthier online environment. Currently, people are becoming more and more addicted to social media, hope this reduces in the future.
